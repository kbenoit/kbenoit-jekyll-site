{: .notice}
  This chapter thoroughly describes the idea of analyzing text "as data" with a social science focus. 
It traces a brief history of this approach and distinguishes it from alternative approaches to text. It 
identifies the key research designs and methods for various ways that scholars in political science 
and international relations have used text, with references to fields such as natural language 
processing and computational linguistics from which some of the key methods are influenced or 
inherited. It surveys the varieties of ways that textual data is used and analyzed, covering key 
methods and pointing to applications of each. It also identifies the key stages of a research design 
using text as data, and critically discusses the practical and epistemological challenges at each 
stage.

{: .notice}
  Probabilistic methods for classifying text form a rich tradition in machine
  learning and natural language processing.  For many important problems,
  however, class prediction is uninteresting because the class is known, and
  instead the focus shifts to estimating latent quantities related to the
  text, such as affect or ideology.  We focus on one such problem of interest,
  estimating the ideological positions of 55 Irish legislators in the 1991
  Dail confidence vote. To solve the Dail scaling problem and others
  like it, we develop a text modeling framework that allows actors to take
  latent positions on a "gray" spectrum between "black" and "white" polar
  opposites.  We are able to validate results from this model by measuring
  the influences exhibited by individual words, and we are able to quantify
  the uncertainty in the scaling estimates by using a sentence-level block
  bootstrap. Applying our method to the Dail debate, we are able to
  scale the legislators between extreme pro-government and pro-opposition in a
  way that reveals nuances in their speeches not captured by their votes or
  party affiliations.

{: .notice}
Borrowing from automated “text as data” approaches, we show how statistical scaling models can be applied to hand-coded content analysis to improve estimates of political parties’ left-right policy positions. We apply a Bayesian item-response theory (IRT) model to category counts from coded party manifestos, treating the categories as “items” and policy positions as a latent variable. This approach also produces direct estimates of how each policy category relates to left-right ideology, without having to decide these relationships in advance based on out of sample fitting, political theory, assertion, or guesswork. This approach not only prevents the misspecification endemic to a fixed-index approach, but also works well even with items that are not specifically designed to measure ideological positioning.
