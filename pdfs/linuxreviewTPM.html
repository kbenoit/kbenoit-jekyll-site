Imagine having a powerful workstation on your desk that integrates
seamlessly with the campus network.  Imagine having a computer that
can run a long statistical process in the background while you use
Netscape and work on a paper you are writing.  Imagine that this same
computer is serving your web pages and receiving your e-mail, and that
you can access it from home or from anywhere in the world using the
Internet.  Imagine that this is your multi-tasking workstation using a
200-Mhz super-fast processor, with a high-resolution color graphical
X-windows user interface.  Now grab a tissue and wipe that drool off
your <EM>TPM</EM> and brace yourself for the best part of all: the total
cost of this system was only $2,500!

<P>
That's because the computer in this reverie is an inexpensive
Pentium/200 running the free Linux operating system.  In this article
I describe Linux, identify its chief advantages (lots) and its main
disadvantages (few).  What follows is less of a formal review than an
unabashed attempt to convince you that Linux is worth using, or at
least trying.  Linux users are notorious for their zealotry, and
rather than attempt to appear objective I will simply make my
prejudices plain.  I have been using Linux for my main computing needs
for over a year now and cannot imagine using anything else--including
much more expensive commercial UNIXes.  So in what remains I will
describe Linux and its hardware requirements, and then identify two
different groups of political methodologists and why they might want
or not want to use Linux.

<P>

<H1><A NAME="SECTION00010000000000000000">
What Linux Is</A>
</H1>

<P>
<A NAME="tex2html1"
 HREF="http://www.linux.org">Linux</A>
is a version of
the UNIX operating system--a multitasking, multiuser operating system
originally designed for high-powered mainframes and workstations--for
systems generally known as ``personal computers.''  Linux comes from
an independent source code base, but behaves exactly like UNIX built
on licensed code.  In technical terms, Linux reimplements the POSIX
specification with SYSV and BSD extensions; in practical terms, Linux
<EM>is</EM> UNIX.

<P>
One of the very best features of Linux is its price.  Believe it or
not, Linux is maintained by a worldwide team of volunteer programmers,
and distributed for free!  Linux was originally written by living
legend and computer folk hero <A NAME="tex2html2"
 HREF="http://www.ssc.com/linux/gx/linus3.gif">Linus
  Torvalds</A>
in 1991 while he
was a computer science student at the University of
Helsinki.<A NAME="tex2html3"
 HREF="#foot15"><SUP>1</SUP></A> In the past several years, Linux
has become skyrocketed in popularity and sophistication.
<A NAME="tex2html4"
 HREF="http://www.webcrawler.com/WebCrawler/Facts/Servers.html">Nearly 85% of computers on the world wide web
  run some version of UNIX, and it is estimated that a huge proportion
  of those are Linux
  boxes.</A>
<P>
The Linux kernel--the basic operating system itself--is updated on a
practically weekly basis by Linus and teams of programmers around the
world.  The source code is completely open, covered by the
GNU Public license which prohibits selling it except for the
distribution costs.  This has allowed many commercial providers to
bundle their own mixtures of Linux and application software, known as
``distributions,'' but has kept the cost to a reasonable figure of
between $15 and $100.  And even the commerical distributions may be
downloaded directly from the Internet for no charge.

<P>
Linux is a completely stable operating system.  I have run it for over a
year using the beta versions of the new 2.x kernel sources until these
were declared ``finished,'' and not a single time has my system locked
up.  I cannot make this claim for any other operating system I have ever
used.  Furthermore, Linux use and product support has exploded in recent
years and shows no sign of slowing down.  Drivers, for example, are
hardly ever a problem these days, and commercial software increasingly
comes in Linux versions.  Perhaps once the <A NAME="tex2html5"
 HREF="http://www.cviog.uga.edu/Misc/info/LinuxBleed.html">bleeding
  edge</A>, and
currently the cutting edge, Linux is on its way to becoming a major
established player in the operating system world.

<P>

<H1><A NAME="SECTION00020000000000000000">
System Requirements</A>
</H1>

<P>
Originally written to run on the Intel 386 platform, Linux now runs on a
wide variety of architectures.  Most common are the ``x86'' Linuxes,
running on the Intel, Cyrix, and AMD versions of the 486, Pentium, 6x86,
5x86, and K5 chips.  But Linux also runs on the Digital Alpha, the
Motorola PowerPC, and Sun's SPARC platforms.  Most importantly, Linux
runs <EM>well</EM> on a variety of hardware.  It ran fine for me for 9
months on an AMD 486DX/100 machine, until I upgraded to a screaming
Cyrix 6x86/P150+.  Linux likes 16MB of RAM and 300MB of hard drive space
to run comfortably, although I prefer 32MB of RAM and 500MB of hard
drive space to run it luxuriously.  There are still people, however, who
run Linux in terminal mode with 6 to 8 MB of RAM and around 100MB of
hard drive space.

<P>
Linux now has drivers for all major hardware, including CD-ROM/CD-R
drives, tape drives, sound cards, even wierd things like virtual
reality helmets.  It doesn't like IBM's MCA bus, but works with just
about every other system architecture available.

<P>
The Linux installation procedure works just as would installing
<A NAME="tex2html6"
 HREF="http://www.microsoft.com/windows95/default.asp">Windows
  95</A>
or
<A NAME="tex2html7"
 HREF="http://www.software.ibm.com/os/warp/">OS/2 Warp</A>.
Modern distributions-such as <A NAME="tex2html8"
 HREF="http://www.redhat.com/">Red

Hat</A>
or
<A NAME="tex2html9"
 HREF="http://www.caldera.com/">Caldera</A>
make this
process very easy.  Installation involves creating a boot diskette,
restarting your computer, and following answering questions about what
kind of hardware you have and which applications you wish installed.
This is also one of the primary advantages of Linux over other UNIXes:
all of the important UNIX software you cannot live without, such as
T<SMALL>E</SMALL>X/L<SUP><SMALL>A</SMALL></SUP>T<SMALL>E</SMALL>X, Emacs, bash, pine, and so on are installed with the
operating system and work as soon as you log in for the first time.
This includes complicated things like networking, web/ftp/telnet
servers, sendmail, and UUCP.  Anyone who tells you installing Linux is
complicated is either using an old distribution or has never been
anything but a Macintosh user.  (I was a devoted Mac user for 5 years,
so please contain your flames.)

<P>
Several X-windows environments--the standard graphical user
environment for UNIX systems--are available for Linux, although by
far the free version from
<A NAME="tex2html10"
 HREF="http://www.xfree86.org/">XFree86</A>
is the most
widely used.  There are also commercial versions which claim more
hardware support and faster speeds, although I have been able to tell
no difference.  Graphics performance will depend directly on your
graphics hardware.  I find that an inexpensive accelerated Mach64
(PCI, 2MB) card gives me excellent performance at 1024x768 on a
17-inch monitor.  Motif libraries are available commercially (although
work is in progress for a free Motif clone); Openlook and several
other window managers are available for free.  I have been very happy
with <A NAME="tex2html11"
 HREF="http://www.hpc.uh.edu/fvwm/"><TT>fvwm</TT></A>,
the ``f'' virtual window manager (use your imagination), which
includes a paged desktop, a configurable toolbar, pop-up menus, and
behaves similarly to Motif.  The latest version of <TT>fvwm</TT> even
comes preconfigured to resemble Windows 95, complete with Start Menu
and the Recycle Bin, if such be your tastes.

<P>

<H1><A NAME="SECTION00030000000000000000">
Why Use It?</A>
</H1>

<P>
If you are not a UNIX user, you ask, then what are the advantages of
using Linux?  Most political methodologists probably use one of the
Microsoft operating systems and interact with UNIX only for network
communications if at all.  For example, let's imagine that you
commonly use Microsoft Word and Excel, communicate with Eudora e-mail,
and need to interface with Netware printers and volumes.  Furthermore,
you run Stata for your statistical needs and occasionally Gauss.
Finally, you use a variety of other DOS/Windows programs that you just
can't do without:
<A NAME="tex2html12"
 HREF="http://www.intuit.com/quicken97/">Quicken</A>,
<A NAME="tex2html13"
 HREF="http://www.idsoftware.com">DOOM</A>, and
<A NAME="tex2html14"
 HREF="http://GKing.Harvard.Edu/stats.html"><EM>EzI: A(n Easy) Program for Ecological

Inference</EM></A>.  What benefits
would Linux have for you?

<P>
Actually, Linux may have several distinct <EM>dis</EM>advantages that
Linux has for you.  First, <EM>there are lots of DOS and Windows
  programs that simply will not run under Linux</EM>.  For example, the
DOS version of <EM>EzI</EM> will not run under Linux; nor will most of
the DOS/Windows software on our campus Novell servers.  This said,
there are ways to get around this problem.  One is to use the
<A NAME="tex2html15"
 HREF="http://www.caldera.com/">Caldera</A>
distribution of
Linux (my personal choice) for which
<A NAME="tex2html16"
 HREF="http://www.sun.com/sunsoft/">Sunsoft</A>'s
<A NAME="tex2html17"
 HREF="http://www.caldera.com/wabi/">WABI</A>
is available: a
Windows Emulator.  WABI will run MS Office 4.3, Word 6.0, Excel 5.0,
Wordperfect 6.1, Quicken 4.0 Deluxe, MS Encarta and Bookshelf, Eudora
mail, and many others.  In addition, Caldera's distribution ships with
a Netware client written by
<A NAME="tex2html18"
 HREF="http://www.novell.com/">Novell</A>
that allows
printing to Netware printer queues and access to Netware volumes.  A
second possibility is the free <TT>DOSEmu</TT> DOS emulator which will
run many DOS programs in Linux.  The Linux team is also working on a
free Windows emulator (named ``Wine'') but it is not yet finished.

<P>
Another way around the software problem is to keep Windows on your
machine and boot up Linux only when you need to.  For instance, I keep
several different filesystems and operating systems on different
partitions of my computer's hard drives, and use OS/2 Boot Manager to
let me choose Linux, OS/2, or Windows 95 when I reboot my computer.
This way I can develop DOS and Windows software on my Linux machine.
Windows, and most other OSes, will run nicely in their own partitions
and not even know that Linux is also there.  Most other OSes cannot read
Linux filesystems, although Linux can read and write DOS, Windows 95,
Unixware, SCO, and NFS volumes, and read-only from OS/2 HPFS and
Macintosh HFS filesystems.  The majority of individual users of Linux
keep some sort of dual-boot capability on their machine.  In fact, this
is how most people get started with Linux: testing it as an additional
OS while keeping their original setup intact.  This is also a great way
to learn UNIX for a very small financial investment.

<P>
A final solution to the software problem is to simply to switch to Linux
versions of your old software.  Wordperfect for Linux is available,
although you could also switch to L<SUP><SMALL>A</SMALL></SUP>T<SMALL>E</SMALL>X, in which case you will
probably soon want to start using GNU Emacs and AucT<SMALL>E</SMALL>X.  Several Linux
word processors and spreadsheets also exist that have no Windows
versions.  Most DOS and Windows statistical packages also have Linux
versions (see <A NAME="tex2html19"
 HREF="#statspackages">below</A>).  This is even
true for many
<A NAME="tex2html20"
 HREF="http://www.cs.washington.edu/homes/tlau/linux-game.html">games</A>:
<A NAME="tex2html21"
 HREF="ftp://uiarchive.cso.uiuc.edu/pub/systems/linux/sunsite/games/doom/INDEX.html">DOOM</A>,
for instance.  Likewise, there are native (and better) versions of
<A NAME="tex2html22"
 HREF="http://www.netscape.com/">Netscape</A>,
<A NAME="tex2html23"
 HREF="http://www.adobe.com/prodindex/acrobat/">Adobe Acrobat

Reader</A>,
<A NAME="tex2html24"
 HREF="http://www.realaudio.com/">RealAudio</A>, MPEG movie
players, drawing and painting programs (<TT>xfig</TT> is an excellent
program not available for Windows), and network communications tools.
And: the Linux versions of these are free!

<P>
A second problem is that <EM>UNIX is not for everyone</EM>.  The power of
a real command shell and the ability to customize your own kernel (the
operating system software itself) come with their own costs.  Many
commercial vendors (RedHat, Caldera, and Slackware) provide some
technical support, but you'll have to rely for assistance mostly on your
own soon-to-grow expertise, publications such as the
<A NAME="tex2html25"
 HREF="http://www.ssc.com/lj/"><EM>Linux Journal</EM></A>
and the
very helpful Linux community on the
<A NAME="tex2html26"
 HREF="news:comp.os.linux.answers"><TT>comp.os.linux.*</TT></A>
groups.  I installed and configured my own system in an overwhelmingly
Windows/Novell environment, but it was not especially hard, and my
network administrator was able to assist with the network configuration.
As long as you have an ethernet connection and an IP address, you should
be able to communicate just fine with your campus network.  I use mail
on a different UNIX host, since I sometimes (although rarely) turn my
system off, but there is no reason why I could not be my own
mail-receiving UNIX host.  (I admit being tempted by the snob appeal of
having my e-mail address be <TT>ken@benoit.harvard.edu</TT>.)

<P>
While installing a good commercial distribution of Linux is no more
difficult than installing Windows 95, it does require some technical
knowledge, especially when your hardware is non-standard.  Also, the
power of UNIX generally is also the power to wreak havoc when you
don't know what you're doing.  One myth, however, is that using UNIX
for your personal computing needs requires you to spend lots of time
as a ``system administrator.''  This is no more true than it is for
any other operating system, unless you are letting multiple users
access and use your system.  I occasionally upgrade Netscape or add
new Emacs <TT>.el</TT> files to my system, but otherwise never touch
my basic system configuration.  And since I log in as a regular user
each day I have no power to destroy the system setup beyond my
personal directories.

<P>
So what are the advantages of using UNIX for you?  All benefits 
delineated in the next section apply to those making their first leap
to UNIX.  In addition, you will find that Linux provides a far more
effective use of your computer resources than does Windows 95 or OS/2
Warp (or, if you are one of the three remaining people who use it,
DOS).  I found both Windows 95 and OS/2 intolerably slow on a 486DX/66
with 16MB of RAM, yet this same system hummed just fine under Linux.
And I used the same software on all three platforms: Netscape, L<SUP><SMALL>A</SMALL></SUP>T<SMALL>E</SMALL>X,
Emacs, and Gauss.   If you are already using Emacs and L<SUP><SMALL>A</SMALL></SUP>T<SMALL>E</SMALL>X for
Windows 95, and customizing your command shell with versions of
<TT>bash</TT> and other UNIX goodies, why not just switch to the real
thing?  If you are a happy user of Wordperfect who uses Windows 95 and
has no idea what <TT>bash</TT> is, then a world of opportunity awaits.
You have no idea of the kinds of uses to which you could be putting your
largely wasted system.

<P>

<H1><A NAME="SECTION00040000000000000000">
Linux for UNIX users</A>
</H1>

<P>
A different group of political methodologists that might be interested
in Linux are those who already use or have just decided to use a UNIX
platform.  Perhaps you use an HP or Sun workstation at the office, and
are looking for a home machine.  Or, you are going to purchase a new
system for your office and want UNIX but only have a few thousand
dollars to spend.  Then Linux may be perfect for you.

<P>
The advantage of Linux for you is this: it will run nearly everything
you want at a much lower cost, and depending on your hardware, at
greater speed.

<P>
If you already use UNIX, then having a machine that won't run Microsoft
Word is not a problem for you.  Linux will run all of the standard UNIX
platform software you know and love.  Indeed, most distributions will
automatically install and configure T<SMALL>E</SMALL>X, Emacs, X-windows, all of the
GNU utilities, vi, xfig, Ghostscript and Ghostview, your choice of
mailer and newsreader, Netscape (depending on your distribution) and
much more.  This includes programming languages, libraries, and
utilities such as C/C++, Fortran, lisp, assembler, Java, BASIC, make,
faces, curses, gdb, xgdb, and tcl.  All at no additional cost and
automatically installed!  The GNU C compiler (<TT>gcc</TT>) is nothing
to scoff at, either: the Linux kernel itself is compiled with it.  So is
Aptech System's Gauss.

<P>
   <A NAME = "statspackages">
So what about commerical statistical packages?  This is a key question
for political methodologists, and has two answers.  First, if you are a
single UNIX user in a PC environment, then you will have to rely on the
packages available for Linux.  But Surprise! the list of available
statistics packages probably includes the ones you use on other
platforms.  Linux versions exist of
<A NAME="tex2html27"
 HREF="http://weber.u.washington.edu/~rons/aptech.html">Gauss</A>,
<A NAME="tex2html28"
 HREF="http://www.stata.com/">Stata</A>,

and
<A NAME="tex2html36"
 HREF="http://www.cas.lancs.ac.uk/software/sabre.html">SABRE</A>.
Most of these packages now use file formats that are binary compatible
with versions from other platforms.  That is useful for exchanging files
with colleagues or students who might use the Windows or DOS versions of
these programs, for example.

<P>
Although the growing number of packages available for Linux is already
impressive, a few notables are not among them.
<A NAME="tex2html37"
 HREF="http://www.mathsoft.com/splus.html">S-plus</A>
currently does not run on Linux and there are no plans for porting it.
Nor are versions of <A NAME="tex2html38"
 HREF="http://www.sas.com/">SAS</A>,
<A NAME="tex2html39"
 HREF="http://www.spss.com/">SPSS</A>, or
<A NAME="tex2html40"
 HREF="http://www.minitab.com/">Minitab</A>
currently
available, although the Wabi port <A NAME="tex2html41"
 HREF="http://wabiapps.psgroup.com/rep2wrk.htm#SPlus">is reported to

run S-Plus for
  Windows</A>.  But there
are ways around this problem.

<P>
For the second type of UNIX user, the one connected to a network of
other UNIX hosts and having accounts on these systems, it is possible to
run other software remotely.  If you have an account on any UNIX system
that has software you wish to run, you can run them as X clients on your
local machine.  Your computer supplies the graphical user interface,
theirs does the computing, and as long as your network connection is
fast you probably won't be able to tell the difference.  This is
currently how I run S-plus and SAS on my machine from our remote HP
network.  This is also a good solution for anyone who can persuade his
or her university's statistics or economics departments to give them
accounts on their UNIX systems.

<P>
This strategy is also useful for computing from home, for those who work
already in a UNIX environment.  Linux can be configured easily with a
<A NAME="tex2html42"
 HREF="http://uwsg.ucs.indiana.edu/linux/mdw/HOWTO/PPP-HOWTO.html">PPP
  client</A>
to
connect to your campus network or other Internet service provider.  This
permits you to browse the web, read network news, use e-mail, and--as a
nice bonus that costs several hundred dollars to set up with
Windows--run X-networking clients remotely.  There is <EM>no</EM> less
expensive solution to provide your PC hardware with X-terminal
capabilities than Linux.

<P>

<H1><A NAME="SECTION00050000000000000000">
Need I Say More?</A>
</H1>

<P>
Not many people use Linux in the political methodology community, but
may more should consider using this wonderful open operating system.
Not only does it do nearly everything that much more expensive
commercial UNIX workstations provide, but it costs less and in many
cases will be faster.  Linux on an Alpha 500MHz platform will provide
you with the fastest microcomputer workstation on the planet, for a
fraction of the cost of a machine from Sun or HP that even comes close
in performance.

<P>
Some benchmark results from my own setup confirm that even a mid-range
Linux system will perform comparably or better than many commercial
workstations.  For example, I ran the <A NAME="tex2html43"
 HREF="http://www.uni-frankfurt.de/~stst/gaussst.html">Gauss speed
  comparison tests from Stefan
  Steinhaus</A>
to see how
my Cyrix 6x86/P150+ ranked.  To my delight its overall performance was
better than that of the HP 715/100 and the Sun Sparc 5 and Ultra Sparc
170!  I also ran a large
<A NAME="tex2html44"
 HREF="http://GKing.Harvard.Edu/stats.html"><EM>EI</EM></A>
<A NAME="tex2html45"
 HREF="http://hdc-www.harvard.edu/staff/ken_benoit/linux/eigausstest.zip">estimation</A>
estimation using <A NAME="tex2html46"
 HREF="http://GKing.Harvard.Edu/">Gary
  King</A>'s software.  It took 41 minutes, 55
seconds on my machine but 48 minutes, 46 seconds on our departments's HP
715/80.  I also ran tests in Stata using <A NAME="tex2html47"
 HREF="http://ezinfo.ucs.indiana.edu/~rmtucker/">Richard

Tucker</A>'s
<A NAME="tex2html48"
 HREF="http://ezinfo.ucs.indiana.edu/~rmtucker/">DyadHard</A>
software for the years 1816-1900.  Creating the dataset took 1 minute,
44 seconds on the HP but only 43 seconds on mine.  These tests and my
general experience indicates that my modest desktop using Linux offers
more computing power than the HP workstation costing thousands more.  I
only allow myself to dream what these results would look like with a
faster processor, say, a Pentium Pro 200 like the one for which Charles
Franklin posted benchmark results on Stefan's page...

Where did I put that tissue?
