My forecast of the final parliamentary seat distribution for the Hungarian elections is the following:

Fidesz: 264 seats (68.4%)
  
MSZP: 58 seats (15%)
  
Jobbik: 48 seats (12.4%)
  
LMP: 16 seats (4.1%)

I&#8217;ve written about this in more detail in [a post on the Monkey Cage blog](http://www.themonkeycage.org/2010/04/hungarian_election_prediction.html).
