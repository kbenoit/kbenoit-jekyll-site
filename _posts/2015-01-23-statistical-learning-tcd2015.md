- Exercise 3:
    1. Using the dail2002.dta dataset, select a random subset of 80% of the candidates, and then stepwise methods to discover the or a model that maximizes the variation explained in this training dataset. Then predict the fit to the 20% that you left out, and report the RMSE.
    2. Following the worked examples from James et al Ch. 6, do Problem 9 from p263 using the College dataset. You can get this from the &#8220;ISLR&#8221; package.
