The best way to unlock modern iPhones using the most recent Apple firmwares is to use RedSn0w. Here is a [guide](http://www.iphonedownloadblog.com/2009/06/20/tutorial-iphone-30-unlock-redsn0w/) for unlocking the 2G iPhones (such as mine). If you want to unlock a 3G or 3GS, you need to jailbreak the phone first using RedSn0w, and then unlock it using [UltraSn0w](http://www.iphonedownloadblog.com/tag/ultrasn0w/), the unlocking tool for iPhone 3G.

The general website for unlocking iPhones, from the iPhone Dev-Team, can be found at [their blog](http://blog.iphone-dev.org/).
