**The Michigan Model**, Professor Michael Marsh

This is classically presented in A. Cambell et al _The American Voter_, which is available via Google online. Critical chapters are 2, 6 and 7. Or look at a redced version, for instance in R. Niemi and H. Weisberg eds, _Classics in Electoral Behaviour_ ch 22 [based on TAV ch 6-7].

A sympathetic  but contemporary restatement is M. Lewis-Beck at al, The American Voter Revisited ch 6-7.
