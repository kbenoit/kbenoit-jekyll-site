The recently formed [European Political Science Association](http://www.epsanet.org "European Political Science Association") has just issued a call for papers for its [1st Annual General Conference](http://www.epsanet.org/generalconference2011.html "EPSA General Conference 2011"), to be held in Dublin, Ireland from June 16-18, 2011. The conference takes place in the excellent [Guinness Storehouse Conference Centre](http://www.guinness-storehouse.com/en/meetingsevents.aspx). (The Storehouse, along with the Book of Kells at Trinity College, are the two most visited tourist sites in Ireland.)
