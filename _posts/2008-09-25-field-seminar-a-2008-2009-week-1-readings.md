**Note:** The latest version of the course handout is available from <http://www.tcd.ie/Political_Science/postgraduate/phdtaught.php>. That version lacks the hyperlinks to the readings below, however.

The **meeting time and place** is Friday 10-13:00, College Green 4, starting 3 October 2008. In practice the actual length of the Seminar will depend on the instructor, and typically will run from 10-12:00 only. While I am the coordinator for the course, the weekly seminars are led by a rotating set of staff from Political Science
